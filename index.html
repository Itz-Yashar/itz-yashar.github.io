<p>In this year's coding class we have learned a lot. We started off with some <a href = "https://education.minecraft.net/">JS / Block coding in Minecraft</a> . I quite enjoyed the Minecraft experiments that we could do with the block code, but personally I like the raw coding more. It's a little more complicated than block code, and learning the language can be hard at times, but I think it just "feels" better.</p>

<p>Anyways, next we moved onto learning <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">Javascript on khanacademy</a> . Javascript has been the hardest, most challenging, and most fun language to learn so far. We learned how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make functions</li>
<li>write conditional statements</li>
<li>use for/while loops</li>
<li>and animate objects</li>
</ul>
			
<p>At the moment we're working on <strong>HTML/CSS code</strong> to learn how web-pages work so that we can make our own.<p>

<p>I've been intrigued by coding for a very long time. Mostly because I want to make my own video game some day. At the moment I'm learning different languages that mostly have to do with web developement. It's been fun so far and not "that" difficult compared to what I've heard about the kind of challenges are part of making a video game. I think it's important though, to know how to opperate a website, because of just how technological society has become, and will become.</p>
			
<p>On the topic of making a video game. I've had many (MANY) ideas over the years but I think I've narrowed my <strong>main</strong> product down to: a low poly art style, large scale, open world sandbox survival, with beafy combat and player movement systems, customizable characters, and (sarcasm) AI like you've never seen before. Now... appart from the AI thing, all that is very much my dream and plan for my (insert emphatic hand gesture here) <strong>main</strong> video game idea. I want to allow people to have fun and be happy... to experience clean and friendly interaction online... and to understand the beauty of an epic, low poly, golden red sunrise over the gorgeous, shimmering, teal blue ocean waves. How much I'll have to learn, the people I'll need to meet and team up with, and the money to make that dream come true is all a matter of time and effort pointed in the right direction, and the first step for me has been learning to use HTML and CSS to write a blog on github.</p>

<p>So that's my Coding Class Recap!</p> 

<p>PS. This blog was made for an assignment in the coding class on the Assemble-together network. You probably noticed the unordered list, hyperlinks for khanacademy and minecraft, and the orange "Heyo" at the top. I did that with CSS in the source code of this blog! OH YEAH!</p>
